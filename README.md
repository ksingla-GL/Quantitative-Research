# Quantitative-Research
I have attached samples of my past independent work to showcase my hands-on experience - these include an end to end pipeline for backtesting & trading using the Zerodha trading platform (API Kite) and NSE exchange API Nsepy-;

1. Data collection through Nsepy and Zerodha Kite APIs (recurring mostly with a frequency of daily)
2. Data Cleaning, modifications (like downsampling) & simple saving
3. Data Analysis & Viz. - triggers the ideas for backtesting
4. Strategy Backtesting
5. Strategy Implementation in Zerodha Kite - for the ones that made the cut
6. Performance Reporting
